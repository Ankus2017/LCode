    Two sum is easy three sum is what they ask today.
    Further more they give you rules such as you can use only one function for instance static int(int num)
    And they want you to give the numbers them selves such it will be written as x1=2+x2=6+x3=1 -> sum=7
    And you can't use any built in Java functions or libraries
